  </div>
<p style="text-align:justify">
  In our observation we met this group of amatuer runners, they had same plan for running in a week, and they were almost in the same age. Before running they did some warm-up exercises together and they had one person as a leader to follow him for doing exercises and on the way to be at the same his speed.
The leader was a professional runner. We watched the members they imitate the exercises eagerly from the leader and it seems they felt happy being in a group with Same physical fitness of each other. 
</p>

### Observation 2

<div align="center">
  <img src="images/observe%20(2).jpg" width="350" alt="accessibility text">
</div>
  <p style="text-align:justify">
    We came to these two friends that they matched very well together for running with regrad to the speed, physical fitness and age, also they were colleague and they had same work time in a week. They came for running after the work in the park that is close to their office. They felt happy and motivated for running. 
</p>

### Observation 3

<div align="center">
<img alt="images/observe%20(3)" src="images/observe%20(3).jpg" width="350">
  </div>
    <p style="text-align:justify">
      We watched this man who was detached from a running group, the reason was he arrived late and the group has already started running. The man did not know the current location of the group on the way, so after doing warm-up exercises, he started run lonely.We watched he was unmotivated and felt lonely.
    </p>

### Observation 4

<div align="center">
  <img alt="images/observe%20(4)" src="images/observe%20(4).jpg" width="350">
</div>
 <p style="text-align:justify">
  During the observation, at the park, we faced an almost 60-year old senior citizen who was jogging lonely with a cane. Later, we realized that he fell behind other runners because of the lack of coordination in his age and the capability in the group. It was crystal clear that he was interested in participating in this activity with others because he attempted to run as fast as possible to reach the group, although it seemed unfeasible. Ultimately, he sat on the bench beside the running track, watching the runners. The shortage of finding the proper groups, in this case, matching with their preferences, made the group running a little bit problematic.
 </p>

### Observation 5

 <div align="center">
  <img alt="images/observe5" src="images/observe6.jpg" width="350"></div>
  <p style="text-align:justify">
  Running with the dog; the activity doing by this middle-aged man; could be a substitution for joining the group. He, like a professional runner, was about 48 years old, seemed to do this activity almost every day because he had a personal running plan. He enjoyed running alone since he did some activities, like playing with his dog, changing the running path, and altering the running pace from time to time, which would be difficult doing them in the group. Sometimes, he ran slow for setting his favorite music on his cellphone, which is one of the essential motivating sources for running; after that, he started running fast. All in all, he was full of the motivation of running because of having these freedoms of choice.</p>
    <!-- <p>For this solo person running alone with the dog, including listening to her favorite music during this activity, is the vital source of motivation.</p> -->

### Observation 6

<div align="center">
  <img alt="images/observe7" src="images/observe7.jpg" width="350"></div>
  <p style="text-align:justify">
  In the beginning of the observation, one woman who seemed around 30 years old, attracted our attention; the woman was trying to find her friends so she was calling them to join them for running. while observing her, it was clear that she had the problem of accessing her friends beacause she called her friends several times. After 5 minutes one of her friends answered, told her the path for running was changed. In addition, it was obviouse that she needed her friends to help her for having a plan for running, if she could not reach her friends she would have decided to leave. </p>

  <img alt="images/observe8" src="images/observe8.jpg" width="350"></div>
  <p style="text-align:justify">
   During our observation, an old man who was around 50 years old became an interesting choice for our observation, he was a retired man, his name was Roberto. After a slow walking he stopped and started to work with his phone. It was clear for us that he became tired and unmotivatd for comming back to the running, his face was red and he decided to find a seat. After 10 minutes he stood up and started to run very slowly.

## Project Description

<!-- [A short paragraph (2-4 sentences) that describes how your project would address one (or two) deep user needs, by including your personal take on suitable strategies to adopt. Mention here the target device(s) (e.g., smartphone, tablet, smart watch, etc.).] -->

Two essential needs would be considered addressing in this project:

- joining the running group
- offering training plan

Group running is one of the most vital requirements, leading to continuous self-motivation among runners, which will deal with by asking some basic questions from runners at the first to understand their specifications, coming with a suitable running club or group to join. Besides, running in a group requires training plans, addressing by the possibility of process observation during the time, followed by offering a proper schedule of running to the participants based on their objectives achieved by questions asked. These requirements would be satisfied with the help of the smartphone as the frequent devices among most runners.
The project is for the people who want to find a club or group for running and need to follow a trining plan to keep motivated. We want to achieve these goals through an application in the smartphone.
