## User Needs

<!-- [Write down the results: list here the 5-6 user needs you identified.] -->

1. The majority of runners prefer running or jogging activity with the other runners, especially those having the same preferences. Like John, the senior citizen; expresess his interest in running with others, but he has to do it alone. Therefore, their specific requirements would be joining the group based on their qualifications.
2. A few runners like Davron; have been kept motivated by listening to their favorite musics and also trying to stay motivated by getting the new running path for future activity.
3. Some specific requirements would be probable met by providing the weather condition in advance or the possibility of sharing each others' tips and stuff.

deep needs :

- joining to the running Group
