    <em>A member of the running group reached late and he did not know the current location of the group in the park, so he started doing warming exercises lonely and lost the group.</em>

  During the observation, at the park, we faced an almost 60-year old senior citizen who was jogging lonely with a cane. Later, we realized that he fell behind other runners because of the lack of coordination in his age and the capability in the group. It was crystal clear that he was interested in participating in this activity with others because he attempted to run as fast as possible to reach the group, although it seemed unfeasible. Ultimately, he sat on the bench beside the running track, watching the runners. The shortage of finding the proper groups, in this case, matching with their preferences, made the group running a little bit problematic.

  <p style="text-align:justify">
  Running with the dog; the activity doing by this middle-aged man; could be a substitution for joining the group. He, like a professional runner, was about 48 years old, seemed to do this activity almost every day because he had a personal running plan. He enjoyed running alone since he did some activities, like playing with his dog, changing the running path, and altering the running pace from time to time, which would be difficult doing them in the group. Sometimes, he ran slow for setting his favorite music on his cellphone, which is one of the essential motivating sources for running; after that, he started running fast. All in all, he was full of the motivation of running because of having these freedoms of choice.</p>
    <!-- <p>For this solo person running alone with the dog, including listening to her favorite music during this activity, is the vital source of motivation.</p> -->

  In the beginning of the observation, one woman who seemed around 30 years old, attracted our attention; the woman was trying to find her friends so she was calling them to join them for running. while observing her, it was clear that she had the problem of accessing her friends beacause she called her friends several times. After 5 minutes one of her friends answered, told her the path for running was changed. In addition, it was obviouse that she needed her friends to help her for having a plan for running, if she could not reach her friends she would have decided to leave. </p>

   During our observation, an old man who was around 50 years old became an interesting choice for our observation, he was a retired man, his name was Roberto. After a slow walking he stopped and started to work with his phone. It was clear for us that he became tired and unmotivatd for comming back to the running, his face was red and he decided to find a seat. After 10 minutes he stood up and started to run very slowly.

After 10 minutes of slow running, Roberto seemed tired and he was trying to reduce his speed. In that time, Suddenly a woman decided to pass near Roberto, he started to run faster so that the woman could not reach Roberto, it was clear that Roberto felt like he was in a competition, he became motivated for running more which had consequences like increasing his speed and feeling stronger.

## User Needs

<!-- [Write down the results: list here the 5-6 user needs you identified.] -->

According to the observations, the following needs are concluded:

1. The majority of runners prefer running or jogging activity with the other runners, especially those having the same preferences. Like John, the senior citizen; expresess his interest in running with others, but he has to do it alone. Therefore, their specific requirements would be joining the group based on their qualifications.<br /><br />
2. A few runners like Davron; have been kept motivated by listening to their favorite musics and also trying to stay motivated by getting the new running path for future activity.<br /><br />
3. Some specific requirements would be probable met by providing the weather condition in advance or the possibility of sharing each others' tips and stuff.<br /><br />
4. Some runners had the problem of preparing the best outfit for sport, As an example Omid said he wants suggestions for the appropriate product.<br /><br />
5. Most of the interviewees emphasized the possibility of having a training plan or schedule; lead to keeping motivated; like Roberto a retired man; take part in a competition with another person with the same level is the main goal using a proper running plan.<br /><br />

<!-- join together [TODO] -->

<!-- - most of the interviewee insisted on the need to have a plan or schedule for running which could keep them forward and motivated for the next run.
- Roberto was the retired man in the pictures, for being motivated he said it is a good idea for him to take part in a competition with another person with the same level. -->

<!-- 1- The runners need a group to join for following same plan, since some people become unmotivated if they run lonely, the group helps them to feel motivated (based on the picture1) -->

<!-- 2- Davide and Marco are friends together and usually they run together after the work and at the weekends, they are in the same level(pace,duration), it is needed to find someone who is in the same age, level and your week schedule. (based on the picture2) -->

<!-- 3- Needs to be able to find the current location of the running track for the runner who is is detached from the group because of arriving late.

4- Lisa was the woman who was looking for her friend to join her , it is needed for her to use a platform which let her find the location of the running group. -->

## Project Description

<!-- [A short paragraph (2-4 sentences) that describes how your project would address one (or two) deep user needs, by including your personal take on suitable strategies to adopt. Mention here the target device(s) (e.g., smartphone, tablet, smart watch, etc.).] -->

Two essential needs would be considered addressing in this project:

- joining the running group
- offering training plan

Group running is one of the most vital requirements, leading to continuous self-motivation among runners, which will deal with by asking some basic questions from runners at the first to understand their specifications, coming with a suitable running club or group to join. Besides, running in a group requires training plans, addressing by the possibility of process observation during the time, followed by offering a proper schedule of running to the participants based on their objectives achieved by questions asked. These requirements would be satisfied with the help of the smartphone as the frequent devices among most runners.
