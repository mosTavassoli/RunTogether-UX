## User Needs

<!-- [Write down the results: list here the 5-6 user needs you identified.] -->

1. The majority of runners prefer running or jogging activity with the other runners, especially those having the same preferences. Like John, the senior citizen; expresess his interest in running with others, but he has to do it alone. Therefore, their specific requirements would be joining the group based on their qualifications.
2. A few runners like Davron; have been kept motivated by listening to their favorite musics and also trying to stay motivated by getting the new running path for future activity.
3. Some specific requirements would be probable met by providing the weather condition in advance or the possibility of sharing each others' tips and stuff.

<!-- 3- Needs to be able to find the current location of the running track for the runner who is is detached from the group because of arriving late.

4- Lisa was the woman who was looking for her friend to join her , it is needed for her to use a platform which let her find the location of the running group. -->

## Project Description

[A short paragraph (2-4 sentences) that describes how your project would address one (or two) deep user needs, by including your personal take on suitable strategies to adopt. Mention here the target device(s) (e.g., smartphone, tablet, smart watch, etc.).]

deep needs :

- joining to the running Group
- Training plan

Group running is one of the most vital requirements, leading to continuous self-motivation among runners, which will deal with by asking some basic questions from runners at the first to understand their specifications, coming with a suitable running club or group to join. Moreover; running in a group requires training plans; addressing by offering suitable ones to the participants based on their objectives achieved by questions asked. These requirements meet through the smartphone as the frequent device among runners.
