## User Needs

[Write down the results: list here the 5-6 user needs you identified.]

Based on my observaitons and images I came to these needs : 

1- The Runners need a group to join for following same plan to keep motivated (based on the picture1)

2- The group members  need to be in the same level (same pace,duration) (based on the picture2)

3- Finding the current location of the running track is needed for the runner who is detached from the group. (based on the picture3)
