# Milestone 4: Usability Testing - Run Together

## Overview and Script


### Preparation and setup 
The usability testing has been done through each pair of team members, one as Facilitator for introducing the application and giving the tasks, and another one as Note-takers take notes of the participantâ€™s behavior, comments, errors and completion of each task. 
The application runned on the faciliator's PC and through Zoom the permission for working with the application was given to the participant and the meeting was recording. The notetaker was connected to the meeting and observed everything. 



### Participants
+ Target population: Amateur Runners
+ Age range: 18-70
+ Basic skills in using a smartphone
+ Expertise with our app: no, never seen it 
+ Usage of running apps: yes at least once in a month
+ Doing running activity: yes at least once in a month 
+ At least basic knowledge of English



### Equipment
+ Computer and webcam (for remote call)
+ Internet connection
+ Pen and paper (notetakers)



### Artifacts
+ [Informed consent form](./docs/InformedConsentForm.pdf)
+ Post-Task Questionnaire: Single Ease Question (SEQ)
+ [Post-test questionnaire (SUS)](./docs/SUS.pdf)

Recruiting is conducted orally, with a brief list of questions to verify that the potential participant respects the constraints.


### Execution
+ **Roles:**  
One facilitator and one notetakers (all remotely).  
The full script is available [here.](./docs/Script.md)

+ **Methodologies:** Think-aloud for tasks 1 to 5  

+ **Post-test debriefing with participant:** SUS questionnaire, oral questions about task execution and general impressions  

+ **Measures (for each task):**
	+ Successful Task Completion (0-1)

| T7   |Find the MILANO group; check its information |Think-aloud|Successful Task Completion(0-1)|
| T8   |Check your created group |Think-aloud|Successful Task Completion(0-1)|


### Post-Task Questionnaire: Single Ease Question (SEQ)
After finishing each task the difficuly level of the given task was asked. 
1. very difficult  	2.	3.	4.	5.	6.	7.very easy

### Post-test oral questions  
+ In general, how was your experience with our application?
+ During the test, **\<something noticed by the notetakers\>**. Can you tell us about it?
+ According to your opinion, which are the best and the worst things about this application?
+ Do you have any additional comment?


## Run the Tests
The tasks were read by the facilitator to the participant, and repeated when the participant asked them.
During the usability tests, we captured screenshots in the moments were necessary while the meeting was recorded. 



## Results and List of Changes

After all the heuristic evaluations, we gathered all the data in order to analyze some of the iussues present in the system.

### List of Changes

According the findings, we came to these changes.

| Task | The Finding | Potential Change |
| ------ | ----------- | ----------- |
|T1| For most of the users the form after running activity was vague, we redesign this form and put proper space between the fields. 
| T4   |User could not find the search and filter box for searching the groups|We changed the UI of the group page for seacrging the groups,The search and filter inputs moved to the top of the page and we divided the page to two sections with the border. After that we did another test (4) and we observed user has not any problem for finding the search and filter box|
