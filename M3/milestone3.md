# Milestone 3: Wireframe and Heuristic Evaluation - [RunTogether]

_ISTRUCTIONS_: Fill this template by writing under each title, according to the instructions reported in `[]`. When you have done, remove this line, and put the file in your private group repository on GitHub, under a `M3` folder.

## Wireframe
[Add here the link to the PDF documents, or embed the images, that represent your wireframe. Briefly explain which tool you used to create the wireframe, any relevant decision you took starting from the outcome of M2, and describe in short the navigation among pages (with a picture or in text).]

Tools: the final wireframe is drawn in Figma
<br/>
After designing the pen and paper prototype in M2, we decided to complete the missing description and choose a better title for the pages in prototype 2, so we add 2 pages containing the actions for start running and discovering last activities in the joined groups. Moreover, the page for Training plan was changed into another design to motivate users more. In the last Molestone, the design for the profile page contained some tabs in the middle of the page and it became an issue, hence we decided to move the tabs to the bottom of the page in a specific menu.<br/>

<b>Feed page</b><br/>
This page is the starting page of the application. In this page user can discover the last notifications or plans for running from the nearby groups or the groups which he joined.<br/>

## Heuristic Evaluation
[Describe here the heuristic evaluation you received. In particular, report your preparation of the heuristic evaluation: which material you used (with links and/or pictures). Then, briefly summarize how the heuristic evaluation was conducted by the facilitator, by including 1-2 photos/screenshots from those taken by the facilitator for each evaluation. Include the evaluation result from the evaluators (please mention which group helped you), for example as a link to the on-line spreadsheet.
Finally, write a non-trivial list of potential changes that your team plans to implement and justify each change by explaining which piece of feedback generates it.]

The evaluation is done with Sportify team through this shared excel document: <br/>

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OdyJ5gXErBWyZoP9PEIsTN6Kymwd0BWhgXqkmuWeM-c/edit#gid=0 <br/>

The facilitator shared the link of wireframe to evaluators: <br/>
https://www.figma.com/file/6H5F2Tti7uppQfdXxuSG5t/profile-page?node-id=109%3A240

first facilitator explain the project and main activites, then ask them to do the some tasks to see how they can be involve with the wirefram, forexample: find a running group, join a group, check the progress in running and in the middle of doing these tasks they encounter with some issues and reported to the facilitator. 

Potential changes: <br/>
1-Return button to home page after joining to a group <br/>
[Feedback evaluator1: You cannot go back after you have joined a run group]

2-Putting this function for filtering the groups based on the location, number of members, max km for runnign and group rate and also by typing name of the group. <br/>
[Feedback evaluator1:Search bar does not appear in the search menu]<br/>
[Feedback evaluator2:The page for searching teams doesn't have a search bar for finding teams by name]

3-Thinking about better icons to convey its main functionality without hesitation.<br/>  
[Feedback evaluator1: Menu at the bottom of the application lacks description; it is not simple to understand functionality of the icon]

4-The proper set of colors will be apply for buttons and texts. <br/>
[Feedback evaluator2: Buttons "Join" and "Cancel" in the page for joining a team and also the "Add" button when registering a team all share the same color, making it confusing]

5-Using the proper words for our actions. <br/>
[Feedback evaluator2: When adding a new team having the button named as "Add" instead of "Save" isn't conform to standards.]

6-Proper place for creating a new group button. <br/>
[Feedback evaluator2: Having the "+" button for adding a new team in the page for searching teams may not be intuitive at first.]

7-Putting placeholder name for textboxes to help user to write the username and at the same time searching that username.<br/>
[Feedback evaluator2: The procedure for adding members isn't easy to understand: requiring the user to insert manually all names in a single text field can lead to errors.]
