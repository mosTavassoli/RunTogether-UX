# Milestone 3: Wireframe and Heuristic Evaluation - [RunTogether]

_ISTRUCTIONS_: Fill this template by writing under each title, according to the instructions reported in `[]`. When you have done, remove this line, and put the file in your private group repository on GitHub, under a `M3` folder.

## Wireframe
[Add here the link to the PDF documents, or embed the images, that represent your wireframe. Briefly explain which tool you used to create the wireframe, any relevant decision you took starting from the outcome of M2, and describe in short the navigation among pages (with a picture or in text).]
Tools: the final wireframe is drawn in Figma
After designing the pen and paper prototype in M2, we decided to complete the missing description and choose a better title for the pages in prototype 2, so we add 2 pages containing the actions for start running and discovering last activities in the joined groups. Moreover, the page for Training plan was changed into another design to motivate users more. In the last Molestone, the design for the profile page contained some tabs in the middle of the page and it became an issue, hence we decided to move the tabs to the bottom of the page in a specific menu.
Feed page
This page is the starting page of the application. In this page user can discover the last notifications or plans for running from the nearby groups or the groups which he joined.

## Heuristic Evaluation
[Describe here the heuristic evaluation you received. In particular, report your preparation of the heuristic evaluation: which material you used (with links and/or pictures). Then, briefly summarize how the heuristic evaluation was conducted by the facilitator, by including 1-2 photos/screenshots from those taken by the facilitator for each evaluation. Include the evaluation result from the evaluators (please mention which group helped you), for example as a link to the on-line spreadsheet.
Finally, write a non-trivial list of potential changes that your team plans to implement and justify each change by explaining which piece of feedback generates it.]
